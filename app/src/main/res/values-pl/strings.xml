<string name="introduction_startpage"><b>Secure Quick Reliable Login</b>\n\nWelcome to the help pages. These pages try to explain the different concepts in the protocol in more detail. We will also try to explain the different use cases available to you using this application.\n\nTo use the help pages you can swipe left or right in order to change page.\n\nIf you are interested in looking at the source code of this application, it\'s open source and available at <a href="https://github.com/kalaspuffar/secure-quick-reliable-login">https://github.com/kalaspuffar/secure-quick-reliable-login</a></string>
<string name="introduction_nutshell"><b>In a Nutshell</b>\n\nBefore you begin using SQRL to log in to websites, your SQRL private identity must be created. You only need one, probably for life, because it reveals NOTHING about you, and it\'s highly secure. It\'s just a very long (77-digit) random number.\n\nFrom then on, whenever you log in with SQRL to a website, your private identity is used to generate another 77-digit number for that one website. Every website you visit sees you as a different number, yet every time you return to the same site, that site\'s unique number is regenerated.\n\nThis allows you to be uniquely and permanently identified, yet completely anonymous.\n\nSince you never need to use an email address or a password, you never give a website your actual identity to protect. If the website\'s SQRL identities are ever stolen, not only would the stolen identities only be valid for that one website, but SQRL\'s cryptography prevents impersonation by using stolen identities.\n\nThis is as good as it sounds. It\'s what we\'ve been waiting for.</string>
<string name="introduction_password"><b>Your SQRL Password</b>\n\nSQRL frees you from the burden of logging into Internet websites by doing it for you. But this means if someone else gained control of your SQRL app, they could impersonate you.\n\nWe solve this problem with an SQRL password which YOU use to login to your SQRL. You decide how much login protection you need. You choose your own password of whatever length and complexity you desire. To impede someone guessing, you set how long any password takes to process. And to make longer, more complex passwords less painful to use, the password\'s first four characters may be used to refresh the full password you recently entered\n\nYou are free to change your password and its various settings at any time. And if you should ever forget or lose your password for any reason, SQRL\'s Rescue Code can be used to recover your access.</string>
<string name="introduction_rescue_code"><b>SQRL\'s Rescue Code</b>\n\nYou and SQRL will probably never need rescuing. But SQRL\'s security is so tight that you MIGHT need a way to unlock things a bit. Here are the two scenarios where you WOULD need rescuing:\n\n• If you changed your password and the new one slipped your mind, there\'s no one to ask. Unlike websites, where you click I forgot my password, your SQRL app doesn\'t know it either. If it did, it could be hacked and used to steal your identity. Backups you have made of your identity will have been saved under the password you were using then, so that might help. But your SQRL-assigned Rescue Code will always forgive any memory lapse.\n• Once you have established your SQRL identity with a website, that identity can ONLY be changed with ITS Rescue Code. If someone WERE to somehow steal your SQRL identity (if your phone was stolen and you used a VERY weak or guessable password, or malware infected your device), they could never replace your identity with theirs. But YOU could retake your stolen identity by creating a new one and using the old identity\'s Rescue Code (which the bad guys would never have) to replace that old identity with your new one.\n\nSQRL\'s Rescue Code is a powerful ally. Write it down, keep it safe and never lose it. You will probably never need it, but if you do you\'ll be very glad you kept it.</string>
<string name="introduction_backup"><b>Why Backup?</b>\n\nYour SQRL private identity is a randomly chosen 77-digit number used to generate each of your individual web identities. NO ONE knows what it is. As you use SQRL to identify yourself to the Internet, your identity BECOMES that 77-digit number. If it is ever lost, so is your Internet identity.\n\nThe other reason to backup your private identity is to copy it to another computer or mobile device. Once your one private SQRL identity has been installed into all of your devices, you can use any of them to easily identify yourself on the Internet.\n\nSQRL provides many simple ways to back up your private identity, and all backups are ALWAYS protected by your SQRL password and Rescue Code.\n\nPrinting backups onto paper, as a small QR code and text (perhaps more than once) is recommended since paper is the original data storage medium. In many ways, it\'s still the best. Simply store it where you store your life\'s other important documents. You can also record your backup to thumb drives, burn them to CD\'s, and store them safely anywhere.\n\nBut PLEASE do make backups, since NO ONE knows your unique 77-digit private identity… not even you!</string>
<string name="welcome_message"><b>Welcome to the Secure Quick Reliable Login (SQRL) client.</b>\n\nThis client app will help you securely and effortlessly log in to websites supporting the SQRL protocol. \n\nIt safely stores and lets you manage your SQRL identity, which the app uses to create unique per-site logins, which are anonymous and give the website owner no secrets to keep.\n\nThere is no connection to any personal information. It just verifies that the same phone that authenticated last time is the same even this time. This makes it possible to create a unique anonymous login on your favorite sites, and you decide how much data you share with the site.\n\nJust to be clear, this application will not hide any identifiers that your phone may provide, but it will not provide any extra data.\n\nYou start the process by creating an identity or scanning an identity generated by another compatible client (like the desktop client supplied by <a href="https://grc.com">https://grc.com</a>) and open it with your password. When your key is loaded you\'re then able to authenticate by scanning QR codes supplied by websites, verifying the address and choosing to log in.\n\nPlease note that permission to use the camera needs to be supplied in order to scan exported secrets, create identities or scan site QR Codes.\n\nTo follow this project on GitHub you can visit\n<a href="https://github.com/kalaspuffar/secure-quick-reliable-login">https://github.com/kalaspuffar/secure-quick-reliable-login</a></string>

<string name="helptext_password_verify_seconds">Your identity\'s security can be improved by lengthening the time required to verify your full SQRL password. There is NO KNOWN WAY for any attacker, spy agency or government to dramatically speed up this verification process. And since your shorter QuickPass can be used after you have entered your password, you only need to wait once. But someone trying to guess your password needs to wait EVERY TIME they guess.\n\nA five-second verification duration is recommended, but you are free to choose whatever seems best for your convenience and security.</string>
<string name="helptext_quickpass_length">To encourage the use of a longer and more secure access password, SQRL can be configured to only require that your FULL password be provided when it is first used and periodically after that. Once the full password has been entered, for a specified period of time, SQRL may only require the first few characters of your password (called a \"QuickPass\") just to prove it is still you. (How long the \"QuickPass\" is active for is called the \"QuickPass timeout\" and can also be set in the identity settings). \n\nYou chose between a longer and safer QuickPass or a shorter and more convenient one. What makes this trade-off acceptable is that the QuickPass MUST be entered correctly on the first try or the full password will be required again. \n\nFour characters are the recommended length. But you may set it as low as 1 and as long as your full password.</string>
<string name="helptext_quickpass_timeout">For protection, SQRL\'s QuickPass will be erased after some time. This time span is specified by the QuickPass timeout.\n\nAfter the timeout, SQRL will ask for the FULL password again on the next login.</string>

<string name="helptext_alterate_id">It is usually sufficient and desirable for SQRL to present only one user identity for each website. For this normal operation, alternate identities are not used and the alternate identity name field must remain blank.\n\nBut there may be times when a single SQRL user wishes to present alternate identities to a single website. Such use might be a quick one-time event to appear anonymously as an identity the website has never encountered before and may never encounter again, or a user may choose to make permanent longer-term use of alternate identities.\n\nAlthough these quick alternate identities can be used to create persistent identities, an alternative is to create one or more additional standard SQRL identities. While that approach can be more cumbersome, for some users and uses it may be more appropriate.\n\nAny characters entered into the alternate identity name field will cause a unique and unlinkable alternate identity to be presented to a website. It will be impossible for the website to connect this alternate identity to the normal identity.\n\nIt is appropriate to regard these characters as the alternate identity\'s name because every time the same characters are used the same alternate identity will be presented. Any characters may be used, but since they must be remembered if the same alternate identity will be needed in the future, a meaningful and memorable name should be chosen.\n\nThe alternate identity names are case sensitive, so they must be reused exactly. Any that will be reused may be written down and permanently recorded to eliminate any confusion in the future.\n\nAlso, note that the alternate identity name is not remembered by SQRL and it is not persistent. It will be cleared after use and must be supplied every time the normal identity is to be overridden.</string>
<string name="helptext_disable_account">Despite the use of every possible protection, it is still conceivable that some entity, whether criminal or civil, might somehow obtain access to your SQRL identity. To protect against unauthorized use, any website may be instructed to disable its recognition of your SQRL identity. In this way, SQRL access can be blocked for your most important accounts. In doing this you will be blocking your own access with SQRL, but also the access by anyone who may have somehow obtained your SQRL identity. In other words, you cannot use SQRL to access disabled accounts, but neither can anyone else.\n\nOnly an SQRL client that has been loaded with the identity\'s secret Rescue Code can re-enable SQRL access or replace a compromised SQRL identity with another. And an identity\'s secret Rescue Code can never be stolen or inadvertently disclosed because it is never carried inside the SQRL software and it is never saved onto any storage device.\n\nSince re-enabling a website\'s disabled identity requires the identity\'s Rescue Code, you should be certain that you have access to the Rescue Code before disabling your own access.</string>
<string name="helptext_enable_account">If you have previously disabled your SQRL account for a specific site, you can re-enable it using this function.\n\nPlease note, that this operation will require the use of the identity\'s secret Rescue Code that was given to you upon identity creation.</string>
<string name="helptext_remove_account">There are several reasons why you might wish to completely remove your SQRL identity from a website:\n\nYou might wish to stop using SQRL to authenticate your identity to a particular website. If so, though it is not required, you might wish to permanently remove your SQRL identity.\n\nOr you might be sharing a single SQRL identity with others, but wish to remove one or more websites from access by other users of that SQRL identity.\n\nOr you might wish to hand over SQRL identity authentication for a website to a different SQRL identity. Unless a website supports multiple simultaneous SQRL identities, you would need to first remove your identity so that the replacement identity can then be added.\n\nTo ease the identity transfer process, the removal of your SQRL identity will leave your current web browser session logged into your website account so that another SQRL identity can be immediately added. This might be important if the site only offers SQRL authentication.\n\nTo prevent the possibility of malicious identity replacement, identity removal requires the extra security provided by the identity\'s Rescue Code. If the identity\'s Rescue Code is not already loaded into the SQRL client you will be prompted to provide it before proceeding with the authentication and identity removal.</string>
